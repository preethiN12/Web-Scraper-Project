### What we did today?

Discuss different types of sorting methods and their related time complexity.
Attempted a sorting algorithm that divided the list in half each time.
Decided to implement a bubble sort algorithm in order to sort the list.
Make a brute force search algorithm to find out whether an item is in the list.
Use debugging skills.
Analyze time complexity using counters.


### For next week
Optimize our sorting algorithm
See how we can apply this to our database
