# December 3 Update
We were able to get the GSON module to work and we parsed the JSON response to get
relevant stock information.

We saved that stock information in a HashMap for easy access.

We created a user interface to allow users to get info about stocks

We converted Python stock manipulation methods to Java and added some more methods
to allow users to get the information they want about stocks.

Note: You must add the GSON module for the code to work
## Possible Next Steps
- Add more methods for stock information
- Add persistence to save data that was retrieved from the API call to file
- Improve structure of code
